ðŸ“š Student Management System Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Project Description
This project involves analyzing a Student Performance dataset using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
The main objective is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data â€” such as the effects of parental education, test preparation, and gender â€” on student scores.
This kind of analysis helps educators identify key factors affecting student performance, which can guide policy decisions and educational interventions.

ðŸ”¹ Features and Analysis
âœ… Average Score by Subject
âœ… Distribution of Math, Reading, and Writing Scores
âœ… Parental Education Impact on Student Performance
âœ… Effect of Test Preparation Course
âœ… Correlation Between Math, Reading, and Writing Scores
âœ… High-Performing vs Low-Performing Students (with scatter plot and histogram)

ðŸ”¹ Tools and Packages
Python 3.x

Pandas â€” for data manipulation

Numpy â€” for numerical computations

Matplotlib â€” for data visualization

Seaborn â€” for statistical data visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€” for interactive coding and presentation

ðŸ”¹ Analysis Summary
We investigated the relationship between parental education and student scores.

We found that high-performing students typically have higher parental education and a completed test preparation course.

We also observed a strong correlation between math, reading, and writing scores.

ðŸ”¹ Visualization Examples
Distribution of total scores by performance group (histogram)

Scatter plot of math vs reading scores by performance group
